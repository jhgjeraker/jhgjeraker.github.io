    <h1>Hello there.</h1>
    <p>
      I made a thing.

    <p>
      This page is just me diving into HTML and CSS with no previous experience.
      There is no real intention behind anything on here, but please enjoy
      the cacophany of badly put together Stack Overflow snippets as I explore the world of webdesign hammer first.

    <h2>Linking to Subpages</h2>
    <p>
      I should probably know how to link internally between pages as I don't want everything on the index.
      The following links point to a few pages where i attempt to implement some basic functionality.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="posts/codeblocks/codeblocks.html">Code Blocks</a></li>
      <li><a href="posts/showcase/showcase.html">Image Showcase</a></li>
      <li><a href="posts/font/font.html">Font</a></li>
    </ul>

  </body>
