      I've created this site as an outlet for me to quickly jot down the results of whatever hobby or interest I currently have going on. Please enjoy this assortment of slightly unstructured content.

      Bought my first non-phone camera in 2021, a 2nd-hand DSLR to learn about the science and technology behind photography. This quickly developed into an interest in astrophotography, realizing that even the cheapest of gear can be pushed to capture the beautiful yet challenging night sky and all of what it holds.

      Though I find the technical aspects of photography more interesting than the art form, I appreciate the skill required to take a good picture, especially in low-light conditions. Now that computational photography lets anyone take perfect pictures every time, playing with "stupid" sensors and lenses is all the more fun.

      I tend to tinker around with small projects unrelated to my work. These are mostly for recreational purposes, small tools I need to improve my own workflows. While most don't go any further than my private repositories, some do end up functional, and I don't mind sharing.
