    <h1>Astrophotography</h1>
    <p>
      I bought my first ever DSLR in 2021, a cheap 2nd-hand Canon 700D, to learn more about the science and technology behind photography. While very interesting on a technical level, I quickly realized that I don't have any particular interest in photography in terms of art or actually doing it.

      I do, however, enjoy space, and astrophotography made for a fun challenge that really pushes the limits of my gear. I don't often get the time, but below are some of my brief attempts at capturing the night sky.
