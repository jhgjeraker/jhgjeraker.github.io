    <h1>2022-04-14 Full Moon Pollution</h1>
    <p>
      My attempt at astrophotography during a summer full moon in the northern hemisphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The location is deep in the fjords of Sogn, a place that usually gets a Bortle Scale Class 2 sky. The weather was good, and I was looking forward to shooting under these excellent conditions. I did, however, quickly realize my rookie mistake of not checking the Moon's phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was shooting with a Pentax Takumar 50mm, aiming at a 7s shutter speed to maximize exposure. The following image, taken at f/2.8, shows the Moon flaring up like the sun during midday. This is not ideal.

    <h2>An Attempt</h2>
    <p>
      Taken back by the sheer brightness of the Moon I didn't pick out any target in particular, but I did want to capture at least something since I was out there.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Location </b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Name: </b>Sogn, Vestland Norway</li>
          <li><b>Lat Long: </b>61.38, 06.75</li>
          <li><b>Datetime: </b>April 14th, ~23:00h</li>
          <li><b>Bortle Scale: </b>Class 2</li>
          <li><b>Moon Phase: </b>Full</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Gear</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Camera: </b>Canon Eos 700D</li>
          <li><b>Lens: </b>Pentax Takumar 50mm f/1.4</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Exposure</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Aperture: </b>f/2.8</li>
          <li><b>Focal Length: </b>50mm</li>
          <li><b>Shutter Speed: </b>7/1s</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Stack</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Software: </b>DeepSkyStacker</li>
          <li><b>Light Frames: </b>100</li>
          <li><b>Total Exposure: </b>10min 30s (90%)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The stacked image has been manually processed in GIMP using n color-preserving arcsinh x100 stretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content-wise I more or less pointed the camera randomly to the sky. After much searching, I found that I've captured Giausar, K Dra, and Thuban in Draco. Can you see it? Too bad about the rogue cloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the Takumar 50mm did a great job considering the conditions, and I'm optimistic about its performance under the same skies minus the Moon.

    <h2>Sidenote</h2>
    While the Canon was capturing the image(s) above, I also shot this image using my Fuji X-T1. It is taken just before midnight, and I thought it looked interesting in a weird out-of-focus way. Looks almost retro.
