    <h1>daikon</h1>
    <p>
      A mini-project where I've linked Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Large Language Model (LLM) queries for assisting with reading, grammar, and word lookup of non-selectable Japanese text.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jhgjeraker/daikon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that native OCR is not available in Large Language Models (LLMs) at the time of this project, but I fully expect this to become a feature in the future. I made this little implementation simply because I don't want to wait. The power of querying LLMs for explaining unselectable text is just too convenient.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Learning to read Japanese without furigana is in my eyes the final frontier. Its presence is usually at the whim of the author, but if you want to read anything more serious than children's material, getting comfortable with raw kanji is essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cant't "complete" Japanese though. No sane man knows all the kanji, but constant exposure will result in steady progress. I'm an advocate of not looking up a single unknown point. If the overall meaning is understandable, have faith that your brain will, over time, remember the patterns. Actively research a sentence only if it is mostly devoid of meaning as you're clearly lacking some fundamental knowledge.
    </p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I take Dr. Krashen's "Low Anxiety Environment" to also includes the tools you use. Learning a language should be fun, but if looking up a word or grammatical point is a struggle, so too will the learning be a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      LLMs have already shown to be an amazing tool for language learning, providing explanations of grammar or sentence structure at your fingertips, but they don't (yet) support OCR, hence this project.

    <h2>The Problem(s)</h2>
    <p>
      Take the following sentence presented with and without furigana.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>これが人類最後の絵になるかもしれないし。</li>
      <li>これが<ruby>人<rt>じん</rt></ruby><ruby>類<rt>るい</rt></ruby><ruby>最<rt>さい</rt></ruby><ruby>後<rt>ご</rt></ruby>の<ruby>絵<rt>え</rt></ruby>になるかもしれないし。</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Let's say you're a budding learner of Japanese and don't know what 人類最後 means (or that it is actually 2 independent words), and want to figure it out in the following scenarios.
    </p>

    <h3>Selectable Text</h3>
    <p>
       Without furigana, simply copy 人類最後 to <a href="https://jisho.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jisho</a>! However, it is not so simple if you try to copy the same word with furigana, <ruby>人<rt>じん</rt></ruby><ruby>類<rt>るい</rt></ruby><ruby>最<rt>さい</rt></ruby><ruby>後<rt>ご</rt></ruby>. Ironically, what makes it easier to read also makes it annoying to look up.
    </p>

    <h3>Non-Selectable Text</h3>
    <p>
      Say what you will about manga, but for learning Japanese they provide an endless source of material from all levels and themes with the added benefit of always providing context through images. The only problem is that even now in 2023, digital format manga in neither PDF nor ePUB come with selectable text. They're all images!
    </p>
    <p>
      The common way around this has been either drawing the kanji or looking it up using radical dictionaries, two methods that both of which have serious downsides and completely break the flow of reading.

    <h2>This Project</h2>
    <p>
      OCR has (finally) become good enough that it can reliably work with both vertical and horizontally aligned Japanese sentences, with and without furigana. This opens the door for all kinds of neat tools that quickly capture unselectable text that can be processed by other tools, like dictionaries or (here) LLMs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just picked some open-source JP OCR model from <a href="https://huggingface.co/">huggingface</a>, made sure I could run it locally, then cooked up a bash script that sends a query to either OpenAI's API or Jisho depending on the command.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows for super useful things like OCR-ing a sentence with all kinds of unknown words and grammar, then asking GPT "Translate and explain each grammatical component in the following sentence: OCR_OUTPUT".
    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Ask LLM with OCR. Once text has been extracted from the image an editor will popup, allowing you to add context like "explain this" or whatever your question is.</p>
    <code>
      daikon llm ocr
    </code>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>
      Let's assume I don't know the kanji in the following example, but I also wonder what "もん" entails in the context. There are no furigana, so I can't manually rewrite the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, now I can capture the entire sentence with OCR, add the question, and send it to the <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> model for a pretty decent answer.
    </p>

      How cool is that?! It was totally worth spending the better parts of a day on this. I can now read in peace.
