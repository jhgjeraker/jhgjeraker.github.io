    <h1>Python Adaptation of rnc-color-stretch</h1>
    <p>
      Python adaptation of <code>rnc-color-stretch</code>, an image stretching software used for post-processing stacked astrophotography images originally written in davinci by <a href="https://clarkvision.com/articles/astrophotography.software/rnc-color-stretch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger N. Clark</a>.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Post-processing is, in my opinion, one of the best parts of the astrophotography hobby. It can be quite relaxing to sit into the hours of the night with a cup of tea and slowly reveal faint details in an image you took earlier. However, when time is more scarce and you just want to see if the shoot was a success, getting even a decent result can be quite challenging on short notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Roger N. Clark's work on the <code>rnc-color-stretch</code> software aims to generate a good color-preserving stretch by utilizing a predefined algorithm coded in <a href="http://davinci.asu.edu/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">davinci</a>. If used correctly, it can produce in minutes what would otherwise take hours. I still think the human touch through manual editing can produce better results, but it is certainly an interesting and powerful approach.
    </p>

    <p>
     <a href="http://davinci.asu.edu/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Davinci</a> is, however, quite obscure and a pain to set up. Additionally, the <code>rnc-color-stretch</code> itself has not, as of writing, been updated since 2017. I therefore decided to adapt the source code to Python, a framework I'm much more comfortable in. It also presented an excellent opportunity for me to learn more about computational image processing, a field I find most interesting.

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      All code is contained in a single file and can be run by the following commands.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <i>python rnc_color_stretch.py &lt;image&gt;.tiff</i>

    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Configuration parameters can be seen by calling with the helper flag.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <i>python rnc_color_stretch.py --help</i>

    </code></pre>

    <h2>Result Comparison</h2>
    <p>
    Below you will find a series of photographs I've taken. Each image is represented by their unedited stack, original davinci and my Python <code>rnc-color-stretch</code> implementations, and my manual edit using GIMP. This project's goal is, of course, that the davinci and Python implementations should match.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each run of the <code>rnc-color-stretch</code> used the same parameters to produce an event testbench. Better individual results can be achieved by fine-tuning parameters per image.
    </p>

    <p>
      I recommend opening the images in a new tab for a larger view. You can read more details about each individual shoot by clicking their related title.

    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    Overall I think the <code>rnc-color-stretch</code> does an excellent job for what it is. I am no veteran astrophotography editor, but the algorithm does a good job matching both the color and details of the manual stretches, in most cases. There are, of course, a certain air of subjective bias in all post-processing, and I do still prefer the manual edits, but this will certainly become another tool in my kit going forward.
