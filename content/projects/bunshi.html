      Kanji may well be one of the hardest parts about learning Japanese, a language that is otherwise quite approachable. It has a rich history, grammar that is arguably simpler than English, and a well-designed kana syllabary that makes me question why we even bother with the Latin alphabet. But kanji is hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are well over 50 000 kanji, but only the most astute scholars even bother with that number [1]. Fortunately, the Japanese government also thinks kanji is hard, which is probably why they released the Jouyou Kanji <code>常用漢字</code>, a curated list of some 2000 kanji that represent a literary baseline [2].
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning the Jouyou Kanji is, however, still an undertaking. Methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTK</a>, <a href="https://keystojapanese.com/klc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KKLC</a>, and <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WaniKani</a> attempt to alleviate the problem by not teaching the kanji directly, but rather as a collection of components onto which they attach custom mnemonics in a predefined order. This is not how Japanese children learn kanji, but it is easy to see the appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, instead of learning <i>like</i> <code>好</code> through rote memorization, see the <i>woman</i> <code>女</code> and <i>child</i> <code>子</code> components. Imagine a woman holding her child, a child that she (hopefully) <i>likes</i>. From experience, this method of learning through association resonates with my brain, and I've had good success with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bunshi is a tiny tool I made to fill a hole in my suite of study techniques. Where I before had to open a book or crawl the web I can now quickly reference the kanji component breakdowns directly in the terminal. This reduced resistance has led to a more active lookup, a positive when the goal is memorization.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      Bunshi works with single kanji, words, or complete sentences.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <i>bunshi これ便利ですね</i>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Each kanji is shown with its meaning, On'yomi and Kun'yomi readings, and component breakdown.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <i>これ便利ですね</i>
      <i>   │└ 利, profit ─ リ、きく</i>
      <i>   │  ├ 禾, grain</i>
      <i>   │  │ ├ 丿, slash</i>
      <i>   │  │ └ 木, tree</i>
      <i>   │  └ 刂, knife</i>
      <i>   └ 便, convenience ─ ベン、ビン、たより</i>
      <i>     ├ 亻, man</i>
      <i>     └ 更, grow late</i>
      <i>       ├ 一, one</i>
      <i>       ├ 日, day</i>
      <i>       └ 乂,</i>
      <i>         ├ 丿, slash</i>
      <i>         └ 乀, slash</i>
    </code></pre>
    <p>

    <h2>Breakdown Content</h2>
    <p>
      While there are numerous separate lists of kanji, meanings, and components around the web, I could not locate a single free source that mapped the relationship between them. As a result, Bunshi includes a breakdown map I've generated myself by combining the following open-source indexes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/cjkvi/cjkvi-ids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cjkvi-ids</a>: Used to map components to kanji.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jouyou Kanji</a>: Used as kanji primary index.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_radical" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kangxi Radicals</a>: Used to source component names.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This works well as a base, but optimally Bunshi would use the same breakdowns as found in either RTK, KKLC, or WaniKani. Unfortunately those are proprietery and I will, of course, not steal their content. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Bunshi does support custom breakdown maps using the <code>--breakdown</code> flag, and if you happen to own either course/book, one could in theory generate and use a breakdown using the same material.
