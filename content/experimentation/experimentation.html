    <h1>HTML/CSS Experimentation</h1>
    <p>
      Just a few snippets where I attempt to artisinally craft some some bare minimum functionality using nothing but handwritten HTML and/or CSS. This way i don't have to include any JavaScript.

    <h2>Code Blocks</h2>
    <p>
    Inline <code>code</code> works just as expected with minimal css.
    </p>
    <p>
      Code blocks on the other hand, not so much.
      I found this weird hack where you first wrap <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>,
      then juggle the indents through css. Strange, but it seems to works just fine!
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <i>for i in range(3):</i>
      <i>    print(i)</i>

    </code></pre>
    <p>
      One can even highlight and copy the contents without absolutely destroying the indent,
      something that is becoming more rare as websites ever strive to become more fancy.

    <h2>Custom Font</h2>
    <p>
      The active font is called "iA Writer Mono", and it is great.
      Made by its namesake company, 
      <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iA</a>,
      it is
      open-source and hosted on
      <a href="https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>
      Inserting images were pretty simple, great. Please enjoy this painting of a bee.
