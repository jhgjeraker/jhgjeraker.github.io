    <h1>Comparing My Nifty Fifties</h1>
    <p>
    I currently own 2 different <a href="https://expertphotography.com/nifty-fifty-prime-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nifty fifty</a> lenses, a
    vintage <a href="https://www.pentaxforums.com/lensreviews/SMC-S-M-C-Super-Takumar-50mm-F1.4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pentax SMC Takumar 50mm f/1.4</a> (7-element), the first lens I ever bought myself, and a <a href="https://www.ttartisan.com/?list_10/113.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TTArtisan 50mm f/1.2</a>, a newer addition to my kit. They're both quite cheap manual focus prime lenses, each just over 1000 NOK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I'd do a few quick tests to better compare the lenses as I'd like to know the strengths and weaknesses of each one.

    <h2>Sharpness</h2>
    <p>
      The image below shows photos taken of a painting at different apertures, cropped at the center and bottom-right corner for comparing the sharpness of each lens under similar conditions. Above f8, no obvious increase in sharpness were found for either lens.

    <p>
      While slightly soft at f/1.4, the Takumar is clearly sharper in the corners. It is usably sharp at f/2, making this lens a great candidate for astrophotography. The TTArtisan is comparable in the center, but doesn't get sharp in the corners until f/4 or f/5.6.

    <h2>Bokeh</h2>
    <p>
      One of the main features of fast fifties is their bokeh balls, and both lenses perform well in this regard. Subjectively I think the Takumar is nicer with it's larger and slightly diffuse bokeh.

    <h2>Vignette</h2>
    <p>
      Both lenses show some vignetting at their lower apertures, though less than I expected. It is functionally gone from both lenses at and from f/2.
